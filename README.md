# action_juggling_robot

This repository contains encodings destined to tackle MAPF with duration on action, using action langage.

* 0.lp : basic implementation
* 1.lp : represent the presence of the robots on the edges
* 2.lp : represent exiting and entering the vertices by the robot (inpired by Å vancara's 2018 paper)

* 1d1.lp : extention of 1.lp with durations
* 2d1.lp : extention of 2.lp with durations
