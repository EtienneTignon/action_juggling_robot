Having difference constrain as a precondition (aka in the body), like action :- difference constraint (action is after the agent is here).

Separate path generation and path checking.

Clingon

at(R,V,T) :- at(R,V,T-1), not -at(R,V,T), time(T).

Add unusual constraints? :
* No cycle
* No path intersection (even in different times)
* Vertices that have to be visited
* Forbid wait before reaching the goal
But this is not MAPF

take care of the _ who can change grounding behaviour
