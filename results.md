Basic variants :

* generate all
 * Readability : Counter intuitive.
 * Grounding size :
  * Rules : Increased
  * Atoms : Slightly increased
 * Solving time :
* immediate consequence
 * Readability : Very good. Maybe even better than basic.
 * Grounding size :
  * Rules :
  * Atoms :
 * Solving time :
* interdependent
 * Readability : Very good. Maybe even better than basic.
 * Grounding size :

  * Atoms :
 * Solving time : Very bad !
* less prerequisites
 * Readability : Ok.
 * Grounding size :

Basic alternatives :

* Chess-like
 * Readability : Good.
 * Grounding size : Reduced
  * Rules : Reduced
  * Atoms : Reduced
 * Solving time :
* Direction
 * Readability : Good, unless you want to know where the agent move in each moves.
 * Grounding size :
  * Rules :
  * Atoms :
 * Solving time :
* Ordered exit
 * Readability : Mediocre. What exit is the 2de one ? It doesn't mean much.
 * Grounding size :
  * Rules :
  * Atoms :
 * Solving time :
* No positions
 * Readability : Mediocre. There is no easy way to know where is an agent at some points in time.
 * Grounding size : Urg ><
  * Rules : Way way worse!
  * Atoms : Similar
 * Solving time :

Basic alternatives using difference logic :

* From ordered path (WIP)
* From unordered path
* From unordered path with cycles (WIP)
