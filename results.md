Basic variants :

1. generate all
    * Readability : Counter intuitive.
    * Grounding size :
        * Rules : Increased
        * Atoms : Slightly increased
    * Solving time :

2. immediate consequence
    * Readability : Very good. Maybe even better than basic.
    * Grounding size :
        * Rules :
        * Atoms :
    * Solving time :

3. interdependent
    * Readability : Very good. Maybe even better than basic.
    * Grounding size :
        * Rules :
        * Atoms :
    * Solving time : Very bad !

4. less prerequisites
    * Readability : Ok.
    * Grounding size :
        * Rules :
        * Atoms :
    * Solving time :

5. more prerequisites
    * Readability : Good.
    * Grounding size :
        * Rules :
        * Atoms :
    * Solving time :

6. moves from at
    * Readability : Counter intuitive.
    * Grounding size :
        * Rules :

Basic alternatives :

1. Chess-like
    * Readability : Good.
    * Grounding size : Reduced
        * Rules : Reduced
        * Atoms : Reduced
    * Solving time :

2. Direction
    * Readability : Good, unless you want to know where the agent move in each moves.
    * Grounding size :
        * Rules :
        * Atoms :
    * Solving time :

3. Ordered exit
    * Readability : Mediocre. What exit is the 2de one ? It doesn't mean much.
    * Grounding size :
        * Rules :
        * Atoms :
    * Solving time :

4. No positions
    * Readability : Mediocre. There is no easy way to know where is an agent at some points in time.
    * Grounding size : Urg ><
        * Rules : Way way worse!
        * Atoms : Similar
    * Solving time :

Entropy alternatives : (Base case : if no mouvement)

        * Readability :
        * Grounding size :
            * Rules :
            * Atoms :
        * Solving time :

    2. Choice based
        * Readability :
        * Grounding size :
            * Rules :
            * Atoms :
        * Solving time :

Basic alternatives using difference logic :

1. From ordered path (WIP)
2. From unordered path (WIP)
3. From unordered path with cycles (WIP)
